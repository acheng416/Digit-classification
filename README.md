# Digit-Face-classification
Implementation of Naive Bayes and Perceptron classifiers to classify digits and faces

Credit for digit and project details given to Dan Klein and John DeNero as a part of Berkeleyâ€™s CS188 course project.
Training and testing data can be found at their website:

UPDATE: Naive Bayes Optimization (98% decrease in running time)
  Naive Bayes has been optimized to classify test data from 250 seconds average to 5 seconds average (100% of training data)
